## About me
Hello — I’m **Pruthvi Suvarna**, an engineering student focused on secure, scalable, mobile-first products. I work on:
- Full-stack web apps (React, Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript)
- Pentesting and responsible disclosure
- Assistive tech and AI-related research

**Quick highlights**
- Certified penetration tester — authorized assessments and responsible disclosure.
- Active open-source contributor across academic and real-world projects.
- Constant learner — building one commit at a time.

## Live overview & analysis (auto-updating)
> All cards below are dynamically generated SVG/PNG from public endpoints — they update each time this README is rendered.

### Overview cards
| | |
|---:|:---|
| **Streak & Activity** | ![Streak](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=Pruthvi-123-prog&theme=dark&hide_border=true) |
| **Top Languages** | <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Pruthvi-123-prog&layout=compact&hide_border=true" alt="Top languages" /> |
| **Profile Trophies** | <img src="https://github-profile-trophy.vercel.app/?username=Pruthvi-123-prog&theme=radical&no-frame=true" alt="Trophies" /> |

### Quick repo-level metrics
- Top repos by stars (live listing via dynamic card):
  - ![Top repos by stars](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Pruthvi-123-prog&show_icons=true&theme=radical&hide_border=true&count_private=true)  
  *(This card includes total stars/watches/forks across public repos.)*

### Compact charts (sparkline-style)
- Commits trend (last 90 days, rendered as a tiny SVG sparkline):
  - ![Commits sparkline](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/commit-activity?username=Pruthvi-123-prog&range=90&hide_border=true)
  - > If the commit-sparkline endpoint does not render for your account, the main stats card above still provides full commit counts.

## How to interpret these
- **Contribution heatmap:** visual day-by-day contributions (commits, PRs, issues). If you want private contributions included, enable that option in your GitHub profile. 3  
- **Streak & activity:** shows current streak, longest streak, total contributions — computed from your visible contribution graph. 4  
- **Top languages & repo stats:** calculated from your public repo metadata (languages, stars, forks) via the GitHub stats service. 5

---

## Styling & micro-animations
- The cards here are SVGs — they can contain built-in CSS animations and micro-interactions (hoverable links are supported on some providers).  
- If you want a more playful animated header (SVG with morphing shapes), I can produce a single inline SVG chunk sized for GitHub README and paste it in — it’ll still be just one `README.md` file.

---

## Privacy / reliability / fallback
- These widgets are hosted by third parties. If a provider is down or rate-limited, the corresponding image might not load. There's no GitHub-side JS to fallback to, so availability depends on the external service. See community reports about intermittent failures. 6  
- If you want absolute availability, I can produce **one** static fallback image (committed to the repo) and an inline `<picture>` block that uses the dynamic SVG when available and falls back to the static image when not. That still keeps everything in `README.md` (plus committing the fallback image).

---

## Want more?
- I can replace the card set with a bespoke *single inline SVG* that draws multiple charts (heatmap + sparkline + repo bars) inside the README — fully self-contained, zero third-party calls. That stays as *one file* and will render exactly the same (but you’d lose automatic updating unless we hack a dynamic image endpoint).  
- Or I can add a graceful local fallback image approach (dynamic first, local fallback image second) to guarantee display.

---

### Sources / proof that this method works
- `github-readme-stats` — generates dynamic GitHub stat cards (SVG/PNG) used in READMEs. 7  
- `ghchart.rshah.org` — a small service to render GitHub-style contribution heatmaps as images. 8  
- `github-profile-trophy` — generates trophy badges (dynamically) for READMEs. 9  
- `github-readme-streak-stats` — generates streak and contribution stats from GitHub contribution graph. Enabling private contributions on profile affects results. 10  
- Known intermittent issues with dynamic readme widgets have been reported; consider a fallback plan if absolute uptime is required. 11

If you want that ultra-safe fallback (dynamic-first, repo-file-second) or a single self-contained SVG that draws all charts inside `README.md` (no external calls), say which and I’ll give you the exact `README.md` variant. I can also inject a tasteful inline SVG header so everything looks custom and fancy — still one file. Which fallback or upgrade do you want?12
